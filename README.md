The final program in CS461 focuses on building a neural network to predict the exam scores of students based on multiple
different variables. This program is written in Python and uses Keras and Sklearn to build the network.

The `src` directory contains:
- `neural_network.py` - the main program file that facilitates the neural network
- `StudentsPerformance.csv` - the given dataset of various student data
- `CS461 Project #3 Report.pdf` - the final project report
